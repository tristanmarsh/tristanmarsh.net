# Tristanmarsh.net Portfolio Website

The personal portfolio website for Tristan Marsh and his Web Development projects

## Getting Started

I can't imagine why you would want to set up this repo, but you can! It's a standard WordPress installation (database excluded naturally). See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Webserver such as MAMP/WAMP
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Enable *AMP webserver stack

```
* do it *
```

Set up repo project in htaccess

```
* do it *
```

Configure WordPress database and install WordPress

```
* do it *
```

Enable tristanmarsh.net theme

```
* do it *


You should now be able to use the tristanmarsh.net theme on your new WordPress Installation

## Running the tests

Take it for a spin, create some pages, posts, navs and look around

### Break down into end to end tests

There are no end-to-end tests

```
You either got it or you don't
```

## Deployment

Deployment of a WordPress installation requires that the databse and wp-config.php be refactored from the old domain to the new domain. Refactoring the database is best accomplished using the [interconnectit SRDB](https://github.com/interconnectit/Search-Replace-DB/) tool.

A standard WordPress installation merely requires the database details to be updated accordingly. WordPress multisite or installations with certain wp-config modifications require domain updates also.

## Built With

* WordPress - Simple but powerfully extendable CMS
* jQuery - It's a website with some interactivity
* Sublime Text 2 - Because it's good

## Contributing

We aren't expecting any contributions to this project as it is simply a personal website theme.
