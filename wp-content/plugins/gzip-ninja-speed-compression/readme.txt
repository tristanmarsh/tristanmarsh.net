== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: How does GZip work? = 
A: GZip uses a common language between browsers to condense (or zip) your website's content and quickly transfer it. The user's browser then "unzips" the content and displays it for view much faster.

= Q: Will this help my website's SEO? =
A: SEO means Search Engine Optimization - GZip is very heavy on the "O" portion of that (optimization). For your website to be considered fast and modern - GZip should be enabled.

= Q: What if it messes my site up? =
A: No worries! We create backups of your files and store them directly on your server before we edit anything. Feel free to restore any of those files at any time.
